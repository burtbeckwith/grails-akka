==================

TODO
----

- verify the info put in readme.md, if are right ...

- add a sample 

- add scala source folders ... ok
    + then verify if some scala content there is compiled ...
    + then verify how to create them even when installing the plugin in a test webapp ...
    + verify if exclude the transitivity of scala (at least put a commented line in the BuildConfig of the  plugin) ...
        * and maybe even a note in the test webapp for it ...
    + verify how to make it load a config file, maybe with a dedicated key under Config.grails (in the webapp or in the plugin ? or in both ?), or using grails.config.locations ...
    + then verify if make an akkaService, and test it

    + try with some local actor:
  http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.0.3/java/untyped-actors.html
        * but verify how from a webapp ...
	
- then, try to use some remote actor ... 
    + for example, run a microkernel application under integration tests, used by grails-akka-test       webapp integration tests ...

- create a sample project where to put common classes for messages, etc ...
    + maybe build it with gradle ...

- enable scala compilation ...

- etc ...
